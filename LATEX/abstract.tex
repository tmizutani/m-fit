\chapter*{\centering ABSTRACT \label{abstract}}

\hspace*{1.25cm}In the field of Video Editing, the main goal is
detecting take transitions, which is basically the connection of the
end of one take to the begining of the next. This work have much
utilities in many applications, such as indexing, recovering,
analysing and video editing. These transitions can occur in several
ways, such as: cuts, fades, and dissolve. This work presents the
M-FIT, a framework that will let the automatic detection of take
transitions from a sample of images (frames of a video) using
techniques based on Visual Rhythm and image segmentation. The M-FIT
allows the user to apply basic effects in the video, so quick and
simple. Your interface is made with QT, making M-FIT a system with a
simple interface and easy for all users.
